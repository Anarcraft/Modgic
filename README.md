## Modgic 0.1.0 @ Minecraft 1.10.2
### By Anarcraft & Team [Underground Lounge](http://uglounge.com)

Modgic is loaded with many of your favorite magic and tech mods. Build your dream vampire mansion, a towering blood mage spire, a huge factory, a Jurassic Park and/or explore the world. Adventurers beware though, the world is filled with dangerous monsters which seem to be stronger than usual.  Legends tell tales of mythical weapons and armors which can bring down these powerful beasts.

To install, open the Technic launcher and search for "Modgic-Beta".<br>
[Modpack Page](http://technicpack.net/modpack/modgic-beta)

Mods already at a stable version won’t be updated until another stable version is available (unless we are forced into updating), beta/alpha mods will continue to receive updates of any kind until they are considered stable.  World resets will NOT be required (at least that’s the goal).

### Requirements:
Minimum of 3GB allocated RAM, Java 8.<br>

These are the java arguments I set, your results may vary depending on your computer specifications.  Modify/disable as needed:
